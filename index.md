## License Terms

Although 95% of Magic's source code is Open Source, and licensed as MIT, Magic will
[cost you a fee](https://servergardens.com/buy/) of â‚¬49 for a single developer license. One such license
allows a single developer to create and publish as many Magic applications as needed (no royalties).
The license is valid for the entirety of the current release cycle, which is the 8.x version, giving
you free updates.
