## A virtual cloud system

In addition to the application generator, Magic Cloud is also a complete virtual cloud system,
allowing you to install it on top of your existing servers, providing you with more or less
everything a traditional cloud vendor provides you with, such as AWS or Azure.
Below you can see some of its fatures.

1. An SQL component allowing you to execute arbitrary SQL and select records through a browser based interface.
2. CRUD generator creating HTTP REST CRUD endpoints automatically wrapping your database of choice.
3. CRUD generator wrapping your CRUD backend in an Angular application automatically created in seconds by simply clicking a button.
4. Browsing and invoking your HTTP endpoints, through a UI that is similar to Swagger/SwashBuckle.
5. File explorer allowing you to upload, download, edit and administrate your server's files.
6. Hyper IDE being a Micro IDE for your dynamic files.
7. Sockets administration allowing you to administrate your SignalR socket connections, subscribe to generic messages, and publish messages as you see fit.
8. A browser based Terminal giving you direct access to your server's operating system.
9. REPL evaluator for Hyperlambda allowing you to execute arbitrary Hyperlambda towards your server.
10. Configuration editor, allowing you to edit your server's appsettings.json file directly from within the browser.
11. Audit logging, with the ability to browse your log, including extracting statistics and filtering.
12. Scheduled tasks allowing you to create tasks in Hyperlambda and schedule these as you see fit.
13. Auth component giving you access to administrate your server's users and roles.
14. Crypto menu to administrate cryptography keys, plus a lot of unique features, such as cryptographically signed lambda invocations, with receipts of execution, etc.
15. Health component to see diagnostics about your systems, such as failed login attempt, other security issues, breaking down bugs and errors occurring in the system.
