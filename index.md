# Introduction

Magic allows you to wrap your database into HTTP REST endpoints for each CRUD operation towards your tables
by the click of a button. It works by extracting meta information from your database, for then to generate
a code file for POST, GET, PUT and DELETE, representing the **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete
operations. This allows you to create an HTTP REST backend wrapping your database, literally in seconds.
