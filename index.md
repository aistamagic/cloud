# Aista Magic Cloud

Aista Magic Cloud is an Open Source Low-Code web application generator allowing you to create your web apps
by clicking a button. It works by automatically wrapping your existing database into HTTP Web API CRUD endpoints,
for then to generate an Angular frontend for you based upon your Web API.

Magic Cloud is 100% open source, and you can freely use it in your proprietary (closed source) projects. Magic
supports MySQL, SQL Server and PostgreSQL out of the box. Magic contains its own DSL called Hyperlambda, similar
to YAML in structure, allowing you to _"declare"_ your logic using syntax resembling that of YAML. This makes it
a perfect _"first programming"_ language, due to that it's an extremely high level abstraction, eliminating most
of the problems from traditional programming languages.
