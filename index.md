Aista Magic Cloud is an Open Source Low-Code web application generator allowing you to create your web apps
by clicking a button. It works by automatically wrapping your existing database into HTTP Web API CRUD endpoints,
for then to generate an Angular frontend for you based upon your Web API.

Magic Cloud is 100% open source, and you can freely use it in your proprietary (closed source) projects. Magic
supports MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, in addition to NoSQL. Magic contains its own DSL called
Hyperlambda, similar to YAML in structure, allowing you to _"declare"_ your logic using syntax resembling that
of YAML. This makes it a perfect _"first programming"_ language, due to that it's an extremely high level
abstraction, eliminating most of the problems from traditional programming languages. Below is a screenshot of
[Hyper IDE](/documentation/magic/components/hyper-ide/), a fully fledged web based IDE, allowing you to create
your web apps by simply clicking a button.

In addition to Hyper IDE, Magic contains a web based SQL _"workbench"_ allowing you to execute SQL towards
your database of choice, integrated audit logging, the Bazar which is an integrated _"AppStore"_ for your
server allowing you to install micro services on the fly, a web based terminal, and literally everything
you need from a modern software development platform. This comes in _addition_ to the fact that Magic
_automatically creates 83% of your backend code in seconds_, without you even having to lift a finger.
On top of this, Magic also automatically creates _"assumptions"_ for you, that are high level integration tests.
Think _"automatically generated unit tests"_ to understand the idea here. Below is a screenshot of the assumptions
component in Magic.

In addition to the above, Magic Cloud also contains its own integrated _"Swagger"_ component, allowing you
to instantly invoke your HTTP endpoints, immediately after having created your code. Below is a screenshot.

All in all, Aista Magic Cloud is your one stop shop for _everything_ related to web application development,
allowing you to generate 80% of your web application's code 100% automatically, by simply clicking a button.
And more importantly, Magic is Open Source, Free Software, and free of charge to use in your own projects.
