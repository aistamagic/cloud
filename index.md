# Magically create Angular and .Net Core Web Apps

Magic allows you to create your entire Web app by simply clicking two buttons. The first button will
automatically create your backend, by wrapping your database tables into CRUD HTTP REST endpoints. The
second button will create an Angular frontend for you, wrapping your previously created backend
into an Angular Web application. Watch the following video for a demonstration of how Magic works.

<div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25%; padding-top:30px; height:0; overflow:hidden;margin-top:4rem;margin-bottom:4rem;">

</div>

## How it works

Magic will read metadata from your database, and use this metadata to generate a Hyperlambda HTTP REST
Web API for you, wrapping all CRUD operations inside of REST endpoints. Then it will use metadata from
the REST API to automatically generate Angular components, router links, menu items, datagrids, etc.
The end result becomes that before you've even had to create as much as a single line of code 
yourself, 50% of your job is already done.

The resulting frontend gives you a datagrid for all your database tables, allowing you
to create, read, update and delete records in your database. It also automatically creates paging,
sorting, and filtering for you - In addition to providing you with a _very, very, very_ secure
authentication and authorisation system.

Magic is built in .Net Core, and allows you to expand upon it with your own C# controllers easily.
It's a highly modular and extendible architecture, allowing you to intercept its core, using adapters
and triggers. The Angular code also perfectly follows TSLint rules, making it highly readable and
easily modified. The process of creating your CRUD apps is also highly configurable, allowing you
to modify any aspect of the end result, before you start coding.

Editing a database record. Notice how it creates the correct components for your columns, based upon
what the underlying data type of your table is. In this particular example for instance, we have a
datetime-picker, because one of the table's columns is a datetime.

Below you can see how the integrated authentication and authorisation components will look like.
Notice, all passwords are securely stored using individual salting and hashed based upon the BlowFish
hashing algorithm - Making the auth system extremely secure.

Magic also allows you to automatically create charts, based upon statistics endpoints, that returns
some sort of aggregate function grouped by some column from your database. Below you can see an example
from the Sakila database.

## Hyperlambda

In addition to the CRUD backend and Angular frontend generator, Magic is also a complete DSL
engine, or Domain Specific programming Language engine - Giving you workflow support, task
scheduling, the ability to create your own DSL, etc. Even if you don't care about its CRUD
generator, it would still be highly valuable, due to its DSL capabilities. The DSL engine just
so happens to easily lend itself to generating backend and frontend code, in
addition to all the other things it helps you with.

## Task scheduler and workflows

Magic also includes a task scheduler and a workflow engine, allowing you to create, persist,
and execute serialized method invocations - Either periodically, or at a single point in the
future, triggered by some action, or at a specific date and time. This gives you the most
important features from Microsoft Workflow Foundation, without the weird and difficult to
understand XML syntax. Magic workflows also perfectly integrates with .Net Core, contrary to
MWF that only works for the full and obsolete .Net Framework.

Hyperlambda hence gives you arguably the same dynamic features that Logic Apps and scheduled
Azure functions gives you, only in a dynamic manner. Below is a screenshot of how you can
manage your Magic workflows using the Magic Dashboard.

## Productivity

If you run Magic towards a database with ~100 tables, Magic will generate roughly 5.000 lines of backend
code for you, in addition to 80.000 lines of frontend code. According to neutral research in
the topic, an average software developer can produce ~750 lines of code per month. This implies that
5 seconds with Magic _equals the productivity of a single developer for more than 9 years_.

Of course, these types of comparisons aren't fully fair some may argue, but there is no doubt that
Magic will soar your productivity to unimaginable heights compared to having to manually create
the equivalent project.

## Maturity and security

Magic has been featured in MSDN Magazine with several articles, and is currently the only product
not produced by Microsoft that is documented at the main website for .Net and .Net Core. You can
find some of its articles below.

* [Make C# more dynamic with Hyperlambda](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/june/csharp-make-csharp-more-dynamic-with-hyperlambda)
* [Super-DRY development for ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2019/june/patterns-and-practices-super-dry-development-for-asp-net-core)

The main architect of Magic has researched Magic and its underlying ideas for more than a decade, and
has been working and consulting for some of the largest financial trading broker firms on the planet - Some of whom
are operating in markets moving 5.1 trillion dollars on a daily basis. Needles to say, but Magic is
_very, very, very_ secure. For some of these firms, Magic has saved millions of dollars
in development costs, while at the same time tightened security significantly.

Magic was also built using a TDD approach, and there are hundreds of unit tests in the project, that
verifies the integrity of every possible course of code flow, whenever we apply change to its underlying
code. Magic's source code, has also been scrutinised by thousands of (human) developers, without being able
to find any security holes in it.

## Code quality and performance

A Magic application will outperform the equivalent Entity Framework solution with at least 5x in speed
and throughput, making it scale at least 5 times as well as an Entity Framework solution. In addition,
its generated code has an extremely high quality, and will for the most parts, perfectly obey by all
coding standards, and/or automated tools that are measuring code quality - Such as for instance TSlint,
SonarQube, etc. In neutral tests, Magic has shown to outperform the average (human) software developer by 10x
on code quality, using neutral and objective metrics measuring quality. This results in that your
resulting Magic application is extremely easy to maintain and modify if the need should arise.

* [Check out the Sonar Cloud quality gates for the project and its sub modules](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/polterguy/projects?sort=-name)

The project also complies 100% perfectly towards SOLID coding standards, and every aspect of the framework
is extendible, allowing you to inject custom logic, and/or change its existing logic, without knowing
anything abouts its internals in any ways. There are probably very few .Net Core projects in this world,
if any, with the same [Quality Gate results](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/polterguy/projects?sort=-name)
as Magic. Each sub module in Magic has on average between 85-100% Unit Test coverage, ignoring some of the
modules where unit testing cannot be performed.

## License Terms

Although 95% of Magic's source code is Open Source, and licensed as MIT, Magic will
[cost you a fee](https://servergardens.com/buy/) of â‚¬49 for a single developer license. This allows you to
create and publish as many Magic applications as you please (no royalties).
