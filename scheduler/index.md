# Scheduling C# methods

CRUD scaffolding is not the only feature Magic provides. In addition to its CRUD scaffolding abilities,
Magic also features a task scheduler, allowing you to dynamically declare your tasks in Hyperlambda, for
then to have them executed some point in time in the future. You can declare tasks to be executed once,
or according to some sort of repetition pattern, such as _"every Sunday at 22:00 hours"_, etc.

This allows you to create automated tasks, that are executed at some interval or point in time in the
future. Due to Magic's Hyperlambda DSL, creating fairly advanced tasks is also relatively easy.
