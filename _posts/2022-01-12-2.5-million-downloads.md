This week we rounded 2.4 million downloads of Magic's NuGet packages. This obviously doesn't equate to number
of users, since users will update their existing installations, and each time a user clones Magic he or she
downloads all of the 35 packages that exists at Magic's NuGet repository - But, a week ago we had 2.3 million
downloads, and even acccommodating for CI and CD pipelines and such, and the fact that each user downloads 35
files every time he or she clones Magic, or consumes it source code version, there is no doubt that Magic is
now currently experiencing _"hyper growth"_ in its user base. The last 7 days we've had somewhere between 50,000
and 100,000 downloads of Magic's NuGet packages. Even dividing this number by 100, implies there's somewhere
between 500 and 1,000 people trying out Magic now on a weekly basis.

My reasons for making this official, is because the most frequent question I get when people asks me about
Magic is; _"Is it production ready?"_ Well, Magic is currently being set into production at several banks in
Eastern Europe, it's being used by one of the largest ISPs in South Africa, and I know about at least one
municipality in Israel using it for their inhouse apps. Magic is being used by several large consulting
companies, on a daily basis, because, and forgive me for paraphrasing the arguments here; _"It makes them more than twice as productive"_.
Hyperlambda is documented at the [Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/june/csharp-make-csharp-more-dynamic-with-hyperlambda),
and the ideas that are the foundation of Magic has been researched and developed now for a decade.

Due to its nature, being Open Source that is, we have no ways to track people who download it for
obvious reasons - But 50,000 to 100,000 downloads per week cannot possibly be wrong comes to mind ... ;)
