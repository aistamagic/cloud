I've been thinking about this move for a long time, for several reasons in fact. First of all I have
an _"unhealthy relationship"_ with Google Analytics. I keep on checking it way too often, almost like an average Facebook
addict checking to see if he's got some new likes. Secondly because Google Analytics are growing increasingly unpopular
these days, in particular amongst EU governments, since it sends information about users to the US, illegally too may I add
according to new verdicts in some EU countries, and we're based in EU, and hence need to comply by EU regulations.
Third of all it makes our site _much slower_. I've spent a _lot_ of time optimising our website, ensuring it
loads as fast as possible, and Google Analytics pulls down tons of unnecessary data from Google's servers, resulting
in that our site becomes slower, reducing quality for people simply looking for Magic out there.

However, my fourth
reason is my by far most important, and it's because I want people to trust us with their data, and Google Analytics
simply is incompatible with such trust. We're using Protonmail and Telegram to communicate. Not because we have something
to hide, but because we want to make a statement to ourselves and others, and that statement is that other companies'
data is secure with us. Hence, in case you wondered, we don't need a cookie disclaimer on our site, simply because we
are not tracking you here at all. Zero cookie tracking, zero surveillance, zero data spoofing. Hence, no more cookies ^_^

Next week I'll go through our fonts and other resources and download locally to our servers to prevent any
3rd party content from being loaded on our site. As a side note I would also encourage people to use DuckDuckGo
and Brave Browser.
