First of all, we're _not_ looking for more people at the moment. However, when we do, we will be looking in our community for resources, implying if you want to land a job with the coolest software company in Cyprus, possibly the world, at the very least what we'd like to see from you is the following.

* Knowledge about Magic's dashboard, its ins and outs, and all of its moving parts
* Knowledge about Hyperlambda, how to use it, and _at least_ one open source backend module built in it
* A passion for open source and open standards

Notice, currently we're _not_ looking for more people. However, when we do, probably some 2-4 months down the road, the above would be the _"bare minimum"_ requirements we'd expect applicants to have in regards to knowledge and experience with our platform. If you want to start preparing yourself today, you can find the download to Magic below.

* [Download Magic](https://docs.aista.com/tutorials/getting-started/)
* [Cloning Magic's source](https://docs.aista.com/documentation/magic.clone/)

As a bonus of course, we wouldn't mind you being able to improve upon its existing source code, providing us with pull requests, and/or suggestions to improvements.
