We have just now cleaned up all of our Hyperlambda and Magic tutorials here the last week, and having
gone through all of these myself today, I would claim that an existing software developer could easily roundtrip
the entire list of Hyperlambda tutorials in roughly one hour. Since these tutorials goes through most of Hyperlambda,
and the helper slots in Magic related to the programming language, this implies that you can teach yourself an
entirely new way of creating software in roughly _one hour_.

* [Our tutorial section](/tutorials/)

The reasons why this is worth while, is because Hyperlambda is literally _ridiculously simple to understand_.
It's got no async constructs, no classes, no OOP, no typing, no constructors, no manual memory allocation,
etc, etc, etc - Just plain simple logic, super easy to apply, without any complex constructs coming in between
you and your business logic. This results in that on average, you can do roughly 10 times as much with Hyperlambda
as you can do with any other programming language given the same amount of code.

Since several scientific studies have concluded with that the amount of cognitive energy and resources you
need to apply to solving a problem is directly proportional to the number of lines of code in your end solution,
this implies you can do 10 times as much with Hyperlambda as you can do with any other programming language,
given the same amount of resources. Basically translating into making you 10 times more productive.
Hence, if you've got a plan for learning something new in 2022, may I suggest you teach yourself at least
one new programming language? At which point I would deeply encourage you to put Hyperlambda at the top of
your list. As of today, this should be really easily achieved, since our tutorials sections has now basically
had a complete cleanup, and partial rewrite, making it that much easier for you.
