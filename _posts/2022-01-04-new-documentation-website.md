Welcome to our new documentation website for Magic Cloud. Hopefully this new structure will make it
easier for you to find the relevant documentation you are looking for. This site is hosted by [GitHub](http://github.com),
and we created our [own custom Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/polterguy/aista-jekyll) for it, which
you are free to use as you see fit for your own needs, since we released the theme to the public under
the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4 license, allowing you to use it for free as
long as you _keep the backlink_ to our site. To navigate the documentation use the hamburger menu in the top right corner of the page.

## Guest bloggers wanted

Got something to say about Magic Cloud, Aista, Automation or Low-Code? Toss us [an email](mailto:th@aista.com),
or even better; [Fork our documentation project](https://github.com/polterguy/polterguy.github.io), create a
new article (or 5), and create a pull request - At which point we _might_ pull it in, assuming it's high quality,
and doesn't provide (too many) shameless plugs, aka self promotion points. One or two links to your own stuff is
OK, but please keep things civil.
