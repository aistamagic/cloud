Welcome to our new documentation website for Magic Cloud. Hopefully this will make it easier for you
to find the relevant documentation you are looking for. This site is hosted by GitHub, and we created
our [own custom Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/polterguy/aista-jekyll) for it, which you are free
to use as you see fit for your own needs, since we released the theme to the public under the terms
of Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike, allowing you to use it for free as long as you provide
a backlink to our site.
