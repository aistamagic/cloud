A friend of mine once told me the following, and forgive me for not completing the sentence yet, but hopefully
you will understand why as I proceed - Anyways, my friend told me the following ...

> If you're the smartest guy in the room ...

Then the sentence goes on. Let's pretend the sentence ends there though, purely as a theoretical exercise,
and let's try to analyse the consequences of the above being a factual statement. Well, if you truly are the
smartest guy in the room, the following facts can purely logically be derived ...

1. You cannot learn anything from anybody
2. If something goes wrong, it's probably _your fault_
3. Everything something goes wrong you need to fix it
4. Etc, etc, etc ...

Being the smartest guy in the room is a curse. Believe me, I've struggled with it myself for a large portion
of my life. Being the smartest guy in the room implies always being depressed, alyways being feeling the burden
of the world on your shoulders, and having everybody else asking you for advice, never finding the time to even
do half the things you planned to do.

Being the smartest guy in the room implies you can never go on vacations, you can never smell the flowers,
and you can never simply enjoy life with your family. Because you're constantly busy figuring out how to
prevent the world from ceasing to exist as we know it.

Being the smartest guy in the room implies being called upon 2AM in the morning, because a web server crashed,
and you're the only guy in the company that can magically fix it.

Do you see the problem here? So let me finish the above sentence for you to make point ...

> If you're the smartest guy in the room, you're in the WRONG room!

Get it ...? ;)

Therefor I ask the universe for the required wisdom, every day, to make me realise I am _never_ the smartest guy
in the room, implying where ever I come, I can learn something from somebody, regardless of how young and
inexperienced the other party happens to be.

Thank you to [Kelvin Okuroemi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvinokuroemi/) for reminding me today of that
I should try to _never_ be the smartest guy in the room ... ;)
