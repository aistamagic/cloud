description: We just published our second miracle release of Magic today, and the main focus was 25 to 50 times improved speed, and some major improvements to its UI.
---

Yet another _"miracle release"_ from Aista. This time the focus was weeding out the remaining UI issues, particularly
related to phones and devices, implying Hyper IDE and the whole shebang now works 100% perfectly on your phone. In
addition we've increased the speed of the thing, literally by somewhere between 25 to 50 times once deployed to
a server, by GZIP'ing static content, turning on aggressive caching, removing redundant HTTP requests, reducing
size of HTTP requests, etc, etc, etc.

In addition we've updated all frontend components to latest versions, created a far better navigation structure,
both the primary navigation, and the internal Hyper IDE navigation, etc, etc, etc. All in all we're pretty happy
about it, hopefully so will you be.

Psst, still 100% Open Source ;)
