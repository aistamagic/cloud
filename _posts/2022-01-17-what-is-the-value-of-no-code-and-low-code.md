title: What is the value of No-Code and Low-Code?
---

According to Gartner the markep cap of Low-Code and No-Code is 48 billion US dollars annually, and it's
growing by 25% every year. It's easy to dismiss this as hype, simply because of all the shiny ideas
we've seen the last 20 years in our industry, and how many of these are on the scrapyard of history today.
However, Low-Code and No-Code is different for reasons you'll hopefully understand as you continue reading.
Before I can explain why, we will have to define Low-Code and No-Code, so let's do this first.

## Defining Low-Code and No-Code

No-Code is to create tools that allows _"citizens"_ to create software, which is why it's often referred
to as _"citizen development"_. Citizens here of course implies people with no prior software development
experience. It's typically implemented by creating drag and drop interfaces, where you can create software
using high level abstractions, facilitating for visually creating software.

Low-Code on the other hand is typically implemented by automating parts of the software development
process, resulting in modifiable code, allowing existing software developers to become more productive.
Obviously there's a distinction between these two ideas, even tough they are often seen as one and
talked about as the same thing. Still there's obviously an overlap, since _"citizens"_ also can
automate the creation of their software systems. For these reasons No-Code and Low-Code is often
referred to as _NCLC_.

Here at Aista we've more or less chosen to completely ignore No-Code. Not because we don't see the value
proposition. Having _"citizens"_ being able to create software obviously has value, if for no other reasons
than that it democratizes software development, and results in access to more resources able to solve the
problem at hand. The latter of course being important in an industry where we have a net negative
unemployment rate, and it's almost impossible to find qualified resources to do a job these days.
The reasons why we've chosen to ignore No-Code is because we believe it's simply _"moving the problem"_,
and we want to _solve_ the problem. So for us it's all about increasing productivity, at which point
we don't see No-Code as a viable and permanent solution. To understand our point of view, please watch
the following video demonstrating our product. It's only a minute long anyways.

## The value proposition

There are roughly 30 million software developers in the world today. To create something resembling
the system we demonstrate in the above video would require probably 2 to 3 of these developers working
for a couple of months. The average software developer probably makes 3,500 dollars per month. This
implies a price tag for the end product of at least $10,000, and probably two months to finish it.
By automating this process like we demonstrate in the above video, we can have a computer assemble
the system in 2 seconds. This reduces the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) by roughly 99.999999 percent,
resulting in that everyone, regardless of how rich or poor they are, can easily create highly
advanced administration systems, to automate and improve upon their existing processes.

Of course the primary business case for this is reducing costs for existing companies. However,
it's easy to forget the more altruistic edge here, which of course is summed up in _"everyone"_
in the above sentence. Imagine non-profit organisations having the ability to become better
at what they do, with better transparency and more efficiency, due to having better administration
systems for instance. Or imagine some system created during a local catastrophy to help
distribute food to the needy, etc, etc, etc.

Obviously we have a business to run, and our primary goal is to make money running our business,
but at the core of our value as a company is _"Serving the underserved"_, which of course is why
we have chosen to release our entire platform as open source, allowing everyone to use our product,
including those without the monetary means to pay for our services. A company is dependent upon
profit to exist, but that's not why we do what we do. Profit is simply _"how"_ we can do what we
do. The _"why"_ of course is different.

Anyways, there are 30 million software developers in the world today. These are making in total
roughly 1 trillion US dollars annually. Our slogan as a company is
_"Automating 80% of enterprise software development"_. When we reach this goal, we will have saved
the world 800 billion US dollars annually. Hence, my notion is that Gartner is wrong, _very wrong_.
The market cap of No-Code and Low-Code is not 48 billion dollars annually, it's 800 billion dollars
annually, and growing ... ;)
