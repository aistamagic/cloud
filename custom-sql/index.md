# Custom SQL

Sometimes you need to modify your automatically generated endpoints. You can do this by editing
the file directly from your Magic dashboard using the _"Files"_ menu item. This works kind of
like a file explorer, allowing you to traverse your file system, on your server, to modify
your files.

Open up whatever endpoint file you want to modify, edit it using the integrated Hyperlambda
CodeMirror editor, and save it. The endpoint will immediately change its behaviour. No
compilation process is required. Below is an example of such a file that was automatically
generated by the _"Crudifier"_. Notice, I have added comments to the file, which is not
done by the _"Crudifier"_ in order to make it more easily understood.

```
/*
 * Declares the input arguments this HTTP endpoint accepts.
 */
.arguments
   limit:long
   offset:long
   order:string
   direction:string
   id:long
   role:string


/*
 * Verifies the user belongs to the "root" role.
 */
auth.verify-ticket:root


/*
 * Dynamically extracts the database connection string, and
 * replaces the {database} part of it with "crm".
 */
signal:magic.db.mysql.connection
   database:crm


/*
 * Applies the arguments given to the file into
 * the [magic.db.mysql.read] invocation below.
 */
add:x:./*/signal/[1,1]/*/args
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*


/*
 * Unwraps the expressions below, and executes your SQL.
 */
unwrap:x:+/*/connection
signal:magic.db.mysql.read
   connection:x:./@signal
   table:roles
   args
   columns
      role
      id


/*
 * Returns the result of the above SQL command.
 */
return-nodes:x:@signal/*
```

The most important parts above are the content inside of the **[magic.db.mysql.read]** signal. This declares
which database to use, what table to select from, and which **[columns]** to select. If you wish to add or
remove columns, you can simply add or remove one of the children nodes of your **[columns]** node, such as
for instance the above **[role]** node.
