# Custom SQL

Sometimes you need to modify your automatically generated endpoints. You can do this by editing
the file directly from your Magic dashboard using the _"Files"_ menu item. This works kind of
like a file explorer, allowing you to traverse your file system, on your server, to modify
your files.

Open up whatever endpoint file you want to modify, edit it using the integrated Hyperlambda
CodeMirror editor, and save it. The endpoint will immediately change its behaviour. No
compilation process is required. Below is an example of such a file that was automatically
generated by the _"Crudifier"_.

```
.arguments
   limit:long
   offset:long
   order:string
   direction:string
   id:long
   role:string
auth.verify-ticket:root
signal:magic.db.mysql.connection
   database:crm
add:x:./*/signal/[1,1]/*/args
   get-nodes:x:@.arguments/*
unwrap:x:+/*/connection
signal:magic.db.mysql.read
   connection:x:./@signal
   table:roles
   args
   columns
      role
      id
return-nodes:x:@signal/*
```

The most important parts above are the content inside of the **[magic.db.mysql.read]** signal. This declares
which database to use, what table to select from, and which **[columns]** to select. If you wish to add or
remove columns, you can simply add or remove one of the children nodes of your **[columns]** node, such as
for instance the above **[role]** node.
