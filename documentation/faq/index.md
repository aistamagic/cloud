## What is Aista Magic Cloud?

Aista Magic Cloud, or simply Magic for short, is an open source cloud based software development platform, based upon
artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development automation. At its core
it is built on top of Hyperlambda, which is a declarative meta programming language, allowing
for the computer to for the most parts automagically assemble your code, in particular backend
code.

This frees up the human software developer to focus on more interesting and demanding tasks,
while the machine can do most of the boring parts automagically.

## What is Aista?

Aista is a privately held company in Cyprus, delivering cloud services and automated software
development services, on top of its own internally developed software development platform
called Aista Magic Cloud. Aista Magic Cloud again is open source, and hosted at GitHub
for those wanting to host it for themselves. Aista's slogan is _"Where the Machine Creates the Code"_,
and also encapsulates our vision and goal.

## What does Aista mean?

Aista means a lot of things. It can be an acronym, at which point it implies _"Artificial
Intelligence Software Technology Assistance"_. In Hindi it implies _"Taking it easy and relaxing"_,
which arguably becomes the end result for the software developer as the machine creates most of your
code. In ancient Gothic it means _"In awe of, and in respect of"_, which are our company values.
While in Greek it implies _"Let it be, leave it go"_, which is what you can fo with most of
your software development efforts once the machine creates most of your code.

## What is Hyperlambda?

Hyperlambda is a declarative meta programming language and hence lending itself heavily to
artificial intelligence and machine learning for obvious reasons, with the purpose of
automagically generating most (backend) code, freeing up the (human) software developer
to focus on more interesting tasks. Hyperlambda is at the core of Aista Magic Cloud, and
is open source in its entirety, and the project is publicly available at GitHub.

## Who invented Hyperlambda and Magic?

Thomas Hansen invented Magic and Hyperlambda in 2013, and continued working on it,
realising it was simply a superior tool for managing and administrating machine learning,
due to its meta programming capabilities.

## Can I generate frontend code with Aista?

Kind of. We have scaffolders that allows you to automagically generate Angular frontends,
and alsoother types of frontends - However, Aista Magic Cloud is definitely best suited
for generating backend code, due to Hyperlambda and its meta programming capabilities.

## Can I create an API with Aista?

Yes. You can literally point Aista Magic Cloud at any database you might have, and click
a button, for then to have Magic automagically generate a complete web API for you in seconds.
The resulting API is super scalable, async to the core, and easily understood due to
Hyperlambda's declarative syntax, making it much more easily understood than a traditional
programming language.

## Can I visually design my database with Aista?

Yes. Aista Magic Cloud contains a graphical database designer, allowing you to visually
design your database, similarly to how you would use a drag and drop user interface.
SQL Studio, our database designer, also allows you to execute SQL and manage your
databases, and works transparently towards SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
and SQLite.

## What databases does Aista support?

At the time of this writing we are supporting the following database systems.

- MySQL and MariaDB
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQLite

We have some basic support for Cassandra, ScyllaDB and CQL, but nothing that's officially
supported.

## Can I visually design my app with Aista?

No, besides SQL Studio there are no _"visual designers"_ in Magic. Magic is based upon
software development automation, and machine learning and AI, and not graphical user
interfaces allowing you to visually design neither backends nor frontends.

## How was Magic created?

Aista Magic Cloud is created on top of .Net Core and Active Events, or Super Signals.
Super Signals again is a simple design pattern invented by Thomas Hansen in 2009, facilitating
for extremely loosely coupled components of C# and .Net classes, resulting in Hyperlambda
ending up as an _"orchestration programming language"_, giving Aista Magic Cloud its
software development automation features.

## Is Magic Open Source?

Aista Magic Cloud is 100% Open Source and free of charge to use. The main backend is licensed as MIT,
the dashboard is GPL, and the plugins are LGPL. This allows you to use Magic to create closed source
applications, while also ensuring improvements to the project itself *stays* Open Source.
