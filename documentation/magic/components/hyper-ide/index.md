# Hyper IDE

This is your _"goto component"_ when you want to create your own modules using Magic. It's a fully
fledged web based IDE or Integrated Development Environment, allowing you to edit your code,
create new modules, and everything you're used to from a traditional IDE. Hyper IDE also allows
you to test your code immediately after editing it by using its integrated _"Invoke"_ functionality,
allowing you to invoke endpoints as you edit your endpoint code, and/or execute Hyperlambda
files, to verify they're working as you are modifying your code. Below is a screenshot of Hyper IDE.

Hyper IDE also provides integrated autocomplete if your editor has focus and you click CTRL+SPACE
or FN+CONTROL+SPACE on your Mac. This allows you to very rapidly create Hyperlambda code, while having
Hyper IDE ensure your code is using existing slots. You can also create files and folders, and also
access the crudifier directly from Hyper IDE. Click the context sensitive menu button in the top/right
corner to toggle the action menu.
