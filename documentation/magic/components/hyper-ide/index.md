# Hyper IDE

This is your _"goto component"_ when you want to create your own modules using Magic. It's a fully
fledged web based IDE or Integrated Development Environment, allowing you to edit your code,
create new modules, and everything you're used to from a traditional IDE. Hyper IDE also allows
you to test your code immediately after editing it by using its integrated _"Invoke"_ functionality,
allowing you to invoke endpoints as you edit your endpoint code, and/or execute Hyperlambda
files, to verify they're working as your modifying your code.
