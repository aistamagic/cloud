# Crudifier component

The crudifier component allows you to automatically generate code, either by wrapping your database
with HTTP CRUD endpoints, and/or create HTTP endpoints based upon SQL statements, and/or create
a frontend based upon your backend. This component allows you to select a database, click a button,
for then to have thousands of lines of code automatically generated for you, wrapping your database
with HTTP backend endpoints with all CRUD operations required to manipulate records and rows in
your database.
