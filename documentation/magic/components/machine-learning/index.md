# The Machine Learning component

The machine learning component allows you to create your own AI based machine learning model, either by crawling your website
scraping it for data, or by manually uploading your own training data, resulting in a private and custom machine learning
model, solving your particular need.

Use cases might be for instance.

* Expert law system, answering legal questions for your clients
* Medical expert advice system based upon AI and machine learning, giving you help when diagnosing patients and clients
* Support chat bot for your enterprise, giving your client support for whatever questions they might have
* Etc, etc, etc

The advantage with creating your own Machine Learning model, is that you can create a private and custom artificial
intelligence. This can become a much _"sharper"_ intelligence than the publicly available ChatGPT AI, with
knowledge about your particular problem domain, that the generally available ChatGPT implementation is not
able to provide answers to. To understand what I mean here go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and ask it about your
company. Chances are that ChatGPT have no idea how to answer your questions correctly. If you scrape your
company website, and/or upload your own training data, you could create a custom version of ChatGPT that
is able to answer support requests, and/or convince leads and potential clients to become
paying customers, etc. This is of course _impossible_ with the general ChatGPT implementation, but
can sometimes be created in some few minutes using Aista Magic Cloud.
