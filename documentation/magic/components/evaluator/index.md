# Evaluator

The evaluator allows you to play with Hyperlambda code, and execute your code in _"immediate mode"_,
for then to see the result of your execution immediately. The evaluator is also a nice starting
point to learn Hyperlambda, since it contains a whole range of _"Hyperlambda snippets"_ that
somehow demonstrates Hyperlambda capabilities, and provides examples for you as you start out
learning Hyperlambda. Click the _"Load"_ button to load up some snippet, study it, modify it,
and then execute it for afterwards see the result of the execution immediately.
