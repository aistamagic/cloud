# Sockets component

The sockets component allows you to subscribe to and publish socket messages. This is useful when
debugging and developing modules that somehow is using the integrated socket slots from Magic.
To understand how Magic's socket library is tied together refer to [this document](/documentation/magic.lambda.sockets/).
The sockets component allows you to subscribe to any type of socket message, for then to see messages
as they are published to your _"channel"_, allowing you to more easily debug and develop your
socket based modules.
