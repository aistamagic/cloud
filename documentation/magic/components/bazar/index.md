# The Bazaar, an AppStore for your server

The Bazaar component is Magic's integrated _"AppStore"_, and allows you to install backend micro
services on the fly, without interrupting normal usage. It resolves towards Aista's Bazaar, that
contains several pre-fabricated backend micro services, serving some generic requirement, such as
translations, email sending, etc. Below is a screenshot of the component during installation of
a module.

Notice, such Bazaar micro services will typically cost you a fee to install into your own Magic backend,
implying you'll have to go through PayPal or some similar payment provider to gain access to the
module.
