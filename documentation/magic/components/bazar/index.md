# The Plugins component

The plugins component is Magic's integrated _"AppStore"_, and allows you to install backend micro
services on the fly, without interrupting normal usage. It resolves towards Aista's repository of plugins, that
contains several pre-fabricated backend micro services, serving some generic requirement, such as
for instance translations, ticket management, etc.

Notice, such Bazaar micro services _might_ cost you a fee to install into your own Magic backend,
implying you'll have to go through PayPal or some similar payment provider to gain access to install the
plugin.
