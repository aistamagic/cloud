# Configuration component

This component allows you to view and edit your server's configuration settings. You server's configuration
is basically your _"appsettings.json"_ file, which is being used in all parts of the system to
retrieve configuration settings, such as for instance when email slots are sending emails, etc.
Below is a screenshot of the component.

Notice, you should be careful as you edit your server's configuration settings, since this might
result in that your server becomes erronously configured, resulting in that your system stops working -
In addition to that if you edit your server's configuration erronously, you might open up your server
for malicious adversaries, gaining access to your system.
