# Comfig component

This component allows you to view and edit your server's configuration settings. You server's configuration
is basically just your _"appsettings.json"_ file, which is being used in all parts of the system to
retrieve configuration settings, such as for instance by email slots as they're sending emails,
to retrieve your SMTP server settings, etc.
