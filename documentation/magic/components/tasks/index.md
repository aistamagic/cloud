# Hyperlambda tasks

The tasks component allows you to create and administrate persisted Hyperlambda tasks, and/or schedule
tasks for executing, either in a repeating pattern somehow, or at an exact date and time in the future.
To understand how the task scheduler works you can refer to [this document](/tutorials/task-scheduler/).
Below is a screenshot of the component.

The idea of the task scheduler is first of all to allow for creating dynamically persisted tasks that can be triggered
by some future event, facilitating for _"Business Process Workflows"_ - In addition to scheduling your
tasks to be executed at some specific date and time in the future, and/or in a repeating fashion.
