# SQL component

The SQL component allows you to execute any SQL towards your database(s). The SQL component also
allows you to export the result of some SQL to a CSV file, in addition to saving frequently used
SQL statements by using its _"Load"_ and _"Save"_ buttons. Out of the box Magic also comes with
a while range of example SQL snippets, implying the SQL component in Magic is also a nice place
to start out if you want to teach yourself SQL.
