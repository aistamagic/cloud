# Administrating users

This component allows you to manage and administrate users in your system, and/or
create new users, and grant access to your backend somehow. Below is a screenshot of the
component.

Notice, this component is especially interesting combined with the registration component, allowing others to
registers in your backend, for then to have a root-user/system-administrator grant access to the newly registered
user according to whatever role the new user should be associated with. To create a new user manually click the
plus button in the top/right corner of the component.
