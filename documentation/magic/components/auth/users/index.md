# Administrating users

The users and roles component allows you to manage and administrate users in your system, and/or
create new users, and grant access to your backend somehow.

The users component is especially interesting combined with the registration endpoints in Magic, allowing others to
registers in your backend, for then to have a root user grant access to the newly registered
user according to whatever role the new user should be associated with. To create a new user manually click the
plus button in the top/right corner of the component, and choose which roles you want the user to belong to.

You can also impersonate users, create reset password links for users, lock out users from the system,
in addition to performing a lot of other user related administration tasks.
