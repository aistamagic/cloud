# Cryptography component

The cryptography component allows you to manage and administrate your server's cryptography key pair, and/or your
server's public keys. The latter which are public keys belonging to others, allowing you to securely communicate
with other Magic servers, and/or clients, using cryptography features such as cryptographic
signatures, and encrypting communication between servers. To understand this component refer
to [this document](/tutorials/crypto-lambda-http/). Below is a screenshot of the cryptography component
in Magic.
