# Crypto component

The crypto component allows you to manage and administrate your server's key pair, and/or your
server's public keys, which are public keys belonging to others, allowing you to securely communicate
with other Magic servers, and/or clients, using encryption features such as cryptography and cryptographic
signatures. To understand this component refer to [this document](/tutorials/crypto-lambda-http/).
