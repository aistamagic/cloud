# Magic's integrated terminal/bash component

The terminal component allows you to directly access your backend server through an interface
wrapping your server's native bash/terminal/shell. This is useful if you for some
reasons need to use native operating system features, and/or programs that does not have
a GUI interface in Magic - Such as for instance when needing to install services and programs
to your backend server. Below is a screenshot of the component.

You can write any bash command into it. What command you can use varies according to what operating
system you have deployed your Magic backend unto.
