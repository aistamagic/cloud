# Terminal

The terminal component allows you to directly access your backend server through an interface
wrapping your server's native bash/terminal/shell feature. This is useful if you for some
reasons need to use native operating system features, and/or programs that does not have
a GUI interface in Magic - Such as for instance when needing to install services and programs
to your backend server.
