# Magic, a Cloud Based IDE +++

Magic is actually a lot more than just CRUD. In fact, the application generator is only _one_ aspect
of the system. Magic has 12 additional aspects, such as the ability to query your database using the integrated
SQL manager. Magic also contains an audit logging modules that automatically logs unhandled exceptions for you, and
everything else that might be of interest to you as you create your own apps. It contains a task scheduler, 
allowing you to create, persist, and schedule dynamically declared tasks based upon your own code, etc, etc,
etc. Watch the video below for a walkthrough of these features.

This arguably turns Magic into a complete and fully fledged _"Cloud IDE"_, to some extent replacing Visual Studio,
and your 3rd party cloud vendor's features, with your own locally hosted version of the same thing. In addition it
contains a micro service runtime environment, allowing you to create cryptographically signed HTTP REST invocations,
containing Hyperlambda code, securely executing this code over an inheritingly insecure connection such as the World
Wide Web. The closest you can find resembling this is AWS' cryptographically signed HTTP invocations, but they're quite
frankly a pale comparison to Magic's abilities.

So before you dismiss Magic as a simple CRUD generator, realise this is only _one_ of its 13 aspects, serving all
possible needs your own custom applications might have.
