## Docker image

The simplest way to get started is to [download the docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/polterguy/magic/releases/download/v8.9.3/docker-compose.yml), assuming you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed, and then execute the following in a terminal window where you saved the file.
This is the exact same process for both Windows, Mac and Linux - And can also be extended
to install Magic in your server or cloud of choice.

```
docker-compose up
```

Then when the Docker containers have been started, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555). Then just use the default configuration settings during setup, type your name and email
address, and Magic should work out of the box without having to mess with anything.

## Manual setup

If you don't want to use Docker, you can also configure your development environment locally on your
development machine. If so you will first of all need the following components.

1. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) + [DotNet CLI and SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
2. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. [Angular](https://angular.io/cli)
4. [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) or [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

In the video below I go through the manu setup process.
