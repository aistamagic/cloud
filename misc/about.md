# About Magic and Hyperlambda

Magic and Hyperlambda is developed and maintained by Aista Ltd, a privately held company in Cyprus, focusing
on cloud, automation, and Low-Code tools and frameworks. The entire codebase is open source, and
you can use Magic and Hyperlambda in your own proprietary (closed source) projects as long as you
contribute back any improvements to the core itself to the community. Due to its modularised
architecture, you would probably want to follow [this recipe](/documentation/magic.clone/)
if you want to clone Magic.

## About Aista, Ltd

Aista is a company based in Cyprus, in Pissouri, Limassol district. We're a small startup with a handful
of employees, and we are exclusively delivering services based upon our internally created Open Source
flagship product called _"Aista Magic Cloud"_. You can find more information about Aista Magic Cloud on
this website.

## About Aista Magic Cloud

Magic was originally created by Thomas Hansen our CEO as a _"hobby project"_, to solve
the repetetive tasks he experienced himself as an enterprise software developer within the
FinTech space, but at some point Magic became such a solid product that we decided to start a company
around it and look for funding. Hyperlambda is currently documented at [Microsoft's website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/june/csharp-make-csharp-more-dynamic-with-hyperlambda), it has 1.5 million page views
at [DZone](https://dzone.com), it's got 2.5 million downloads of its NuGet packages, increasing with roughly
50,000 to 100,000 on a weekly basis, and is probably the fastest growing Open Source framework
in existence in the world as of today.

## Open positions - Frontend Team Lead

We are currently looking for a team lead frontend developer, preferably an Angular developer.
The role is expected to at least partially be on location here in Cyprus/Pissouri, but for the right
candidate we are willing to discuss alternatives here. Your task will be to create an automatic
onboarding system for Magic Cloud, and the frontend parts of it is 100% greenfield, so it would be
assumed you are able to initiate and start this project, having a solid understanding of architectural
best practices in the frontend space, and the ability to implement a good and solid foundation we can
live with for years to come. Bonus points will be given if you also know some of the technologies below.

* DevOps
* Agile
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Linux administration
* GoLang
* Micro Service theory
* DDD (Domain Driven Design)
* C# and .Net Core
* ScyllaDB and distributed database theory
* CI/CD theory, in particular related to GitHub actions, YAML, and automated pipelines

Although we are looking for a _"hands on"_ resource, we assume you'd be willing to take on
leadership responsibilities in the future as your team grows, and that you're able to manage
and administrate a small team of frontend developers. We anticipate hiring more developers
for your team over the next 6 to 12 months - However, an extremely good eye for clean and solid
architecture is a must, and we're looking for an autonomous developer, able to translate use
cases and business requirements into working solid code. If you have the _"entrepreneural spirit"_,
and working with Open Source gives you a rush, and products used indirectly by millions of people
on a daily basis turns you on, we would love to talk with you. Contact our CEO
[Thomas Hansen](mailto:th@aista.com) if this sounds interesting.

## About the website design

The theme we are using at our website is created by Aista as an Open Source Jekyll theme, allowing
you to use it for your own website if you wish. The theme is highly customisable, supports blogging,
and custom navigation links. You can find instructions for how to use it on your
own website [here](https://github.com/polterguy/aista-jekyll).
