# About Magic and Hyperlambda

Magic and Hyperlambda is developed and maintained by Aista Ltd, a privately held company in Cyprus, focusing
on cloud, automation, and Low-Code tools and frameworks. The entire codebase is open source, and
you can use Magic and Hyperlambda in your own proprietary (closed source) projects as long as you
contribute back any improvements to the core itself to the community. Due to its modularised
architecture, you would probably want to follow [this recipe](/documentation/magic.clone/)
if you want to clone Magic.

## About Aista, Ltd

Aista is a company based in Cyprus, in Pissouri, Limassol district. We're a small startup with a handful
of employees, and we are exclusively delivering services based upon our internally created Open Source
flagship product called _"Aista Magic Cloud"_. You can find more information about Aista Magic Cloud on
this website.

## About Aista Magic Cloud

Magic was originally created by Thomas Hansen our CEO as a _"hobby project"_, to solve
the repetetive tasks he experienced himself as an enterprise software developer within the
FinTech space, but at some point Magic became such a solid product that we decided to start a company
around it and look for funding. Hyperlambda is currently documented at [Microsoft's website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/june/csharp-make-csharp-more-dynamic-with-hyperlambda), it has 1.5 million page views
at [DZone](https://dzone.com), it's got 2.5 million downloads of its NuGet packages, increasing with roughly
50,000 to 100,000 on a weekly basis, and is probably the fastest growing Open Source framework
in the world as of today.

you to use it for your own website if you wish. The theme is highly customisable, supports blogging,
and custom navigation links. You can find instructions for how to use it on your
own website [here](https://github.com/polterguy/aista-jekyll).
