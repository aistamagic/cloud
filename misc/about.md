# About Magic, Aista and Hyperlambda

Aista Magic Cloud and Hyperlambda is developed and maintained by Aista Ltd, a privately held company in Cyprus, focusing
on cloud, software development automation, artificial intelligence, and Low-Code frameworks. The entire codebase is
open source, and you can use Magic and Hyperlambda in your own proprietary (closed source) projects as long as you
contribute back any improvements to the core itself. Due to its modularised
architecture, you would probably want to follow [this recipe](/documentation/magic.clone/)

of employees, and we are delivering services based upon our internally created Open Source

## About Aista Magic Cloud

Magic was originally created by Thomas Hansen our CEO as a _"hobby project"_, to solve
the repetetive tasks he experienced himself as an enterprise software developer within the
FinTech space, but at some point Magic became such a solid product that we decided to start a company
around it and look for funding. Hyperlambda is currently documented at [Microsoft's website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/june/csharp-make-csharp-more-dynamic-with-hyperlambda), it has 1.5 million page views
at [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/3044876/mrgaia.html), and it's got roughly 4 million downloads of its NuGet packages.
