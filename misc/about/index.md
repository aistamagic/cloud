# About Magic and Hyperlambda

Magic and Hyperlambda is developed and maintained by Aista Ltd, a privately held company in Cyprus focusing
on cloud, automation and Low-Code tools. The entire codebase is open source, and
you can use Magic and Hyperlambda in your own proprietary (closed source) projects, as long as you
contribute back any improvements to the core itself to the community. However, due to the modularised
architecture of Magic, you would probably want to follow [this recipe](/documentation/magic.clone/)
if you want to clone the project.

The theme we are using at our website is created by Aista as an Open Source Jekyll theme, allowing
you to use it for your own website if you wish. The theme is highly customisable, supports blogging
and custom navigation links, and you can find instructions for how to use it on your
own website [here](https://github.com/polterguy/aista-jekyll).
